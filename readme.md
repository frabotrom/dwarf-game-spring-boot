Dwarf is a one to three player worker placement game of mining, forging, and battling in the shifting tunnels and caverns of an ancient mountain hold. Players take on the role of different Dwarf clans and attempt to contribute the most to society. This is done, of course, by forging useful and beautiful tools and trinkets, but also by amassing piles of gold and steel. Dwarf society is peculiar, to say the least. Throughout their mining and crafting journey, players will also have to deal with dragons, orcs, and other baddies that dole out punishment to every player unless some brave soul goes off to confront them. That’s a lot for each clan to handle, but navigating the trials of the mountain and emerging victorious will cement a clan’s name for eternity.
